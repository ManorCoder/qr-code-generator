## Implementation Process

At the beginning, I analyzed and reviewed the challenge requirements and the style guide, paying special attention to the mobile design to implement it correctly. I made sure to follow the design guidelines to ensure that the QR component met expectations.

### Process Steps:

1. **Mobile Structure**: The first step was focusing on the basic mobile layout structure, ensuring that the component was simple and functional on small screens.

2. **Class Naming**: In the second step, I used some AI assistance to improve the class names. Personally, I struggle with finding clear and understandable names for classes, so this help was useful in giving them more meaningful and descriptive names.

3. **CSS Design**: The third step was the design with CSS. Here I faced some issues with implementing responsiveness for desktop, as I made mistakes with the layout of the containers and the description. However, I was able to correct these errors and adjust the layout.

### Construction Process:

- **Mobile-first Approach**: I started by working on the mobile layout, following the "mobile-first" methodology.
- **Use of Flexbox**: I used Flexbox to efficiently organize the elements and ensure that the content was properly centered.
- **CSS Styling**: I applied the necessary style properties to make the component visually appealing and functional.
- **Media Queries for Desktop**: I implemented media queries to adjust the layout for larger screens and ensure it remained responsive.

### What I Learned

One of the most important lessons I learned was the need to improve the structuring of HTML, especially when creating containers and boxes. Sometimes I tend to add unnecessary elements that complicate the design. I learned that itâ€™s better to keep it simple and avoid excessive containers.

An example I did earlier:

```html
<div class="description-container">
  <div>
    <h2 class="title">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h2>
  </div>
  <div>
    <p class="text">Scan the QR code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
  </div>
</div>
```

This code was unnecessarily complex and made the design harder to manage. By simplifying it, I was able to make the component cleaner and easier to maintain.

### Using AI to Improve Documentation Writing
To improve the clarity and coherence of the documentation, I used artificial intelligence tools. This helped me generate more understandable and well-structured descriptions in the comments and explanations of the code, making it easier to read and understand the solution.
